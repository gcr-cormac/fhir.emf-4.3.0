  Generated on Thu, Dec 27, 2018 22:37+1100 for FHIR v4.0.0 

  Note: the schemas &amp; schematrons do not contain all of the rules about what makes resources
  valid. Implementers will still need to be familiar with the content of the specification and with
  any profiles that apply to the resources in order to make a conformant implementation.
